# TheThing

Hello! Thank you for looking through our code for our ME-4405 final project - The Thing!

Here's a quick note about the project organization:

"SubsystemOneJoysticks"-> This is the code for the remote transmitter! It only went through relatively minor tweaks after our first subsystem demo.
"SubsystemOneLEDs" -> Although this was significantly updated from how it was run in the subsystem one demo, the SPI code was much more viable for repurposing than the PWM motor code from the subsystem two demo. In hindsight, this should have been simply copied, but as it stands it was largely modified instead, hence the legacy name.

For code clarification questions, please reach out! 
Here's where you can reach Graham, who should be quite familiar with the layout of the STM32CubeIDE project structure, as well as most of the code: grahamtokarz@gmail.com

Thanks again!
